A very simple tic-tac-toe game made using JS 

this project was to help my understanding of JS , specifically using arrays

some things to note, i will come back and add a tie function when no one wins, as it sort of just crashes if no one wins .. lol

also want to add best of 5 function and make the O actually try to win
